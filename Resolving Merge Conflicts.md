Merge conflicts occur when Git is unable to automatically merge changes from different branches. This often happens when two branches have made conflicting changes to the same part of a file. Follow the steps below to resolve merge conflicts:

## Resolving Merge Conflicts Locally

1. **Identify Merge Conflicts:**
   - When you attempt to merge branches, Git will notify you if there are conflicts.
   - You'll see a message indicating which files have conflicts.

2. **Open Conflicted Files:**
   - Open the conflicted files in your code editor.
   - Git will mark the conflicting sections within the file.

3. **Resolve Conflicts:**
   - Manually edit the conflicted sections to resolve the differences.
   - Decide which changes to keep, modify, or remove.
   - Remove the conflict markers (`<<<<<<<`, `=======`, `>>>>>>>`) once conflicts are resolved.

4. **Save Changes:**
   - Save the changes to the conflicted files once conflicts are resolved.

5. **Add Resolved Files:**
   - After resolving conflicts, stage the resolved files for commit:
     ```bash
     git add <resolved_file1> <resolved_file2> ...
     ```

6. **Commit Changes:**
   - Commit the resolved changes:
     ```bash
     git commit -m "Resolve merge conflicts"
     ```

7. **Continue with Merge:**
   - After resolving conflicts and committing changes, continue with the merge process.

## Resolving Merge Conflicts on GitHub

1. **Navigate to Pull Request:**
   - If conflicts occur during a pull request merge on GitHub, navigate to the pull request.

2. **Review Conflicts:**
   - GitHub will highlight the conflicting files and sections within the pull request.

3. **Resolve Conflicts Online:**
   - Click on the conflicted file to open the file editor.
   - Make necessary changes directly within the GitHub interface.

4. **Commit Changes:**
   - Once conflicts are resolved, commit the changes directly on GitHub.
   - Provide a commit message describing the conflict resolution.

5. **Complete Merge:**
   - After resolving conflicts and committing changes, complete the merge on GitHub.

That's it! You've successfully resolved merge conflicts, ensuring smooth integration of changes from different branches.
